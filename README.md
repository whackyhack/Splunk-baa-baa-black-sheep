# Splunk-baa-baa-black-sheep
In this demo dashboard, linguistic and semantic constructs in Baa, baa, black sheep are used to illustrate how "hidden" fields can be used to enhance visualization, especially (but not limited to) text visualization.  It also demonstrates some advanced text visualization techniques.

This dashboard is for Dashboard Studio, and requires Splunk 9.4.0 and higher to display multiple tabs.

# Rack view
This demo dashboard demonstrates a practical application of the "tower" view exemplified in Baa, baa, black sheep.

When the dashboard loads, only server names are displayed.  You can add model, temperature, etc., into the view.  You can also select racks or other attributes of interest, all on a 42-unit vertical ladder.

This dashboard is tested in Splunk 9.4.0 Dashboard Studio but should be compatible with any versions of Dashboard Studio (starting Splunk 8.0).
